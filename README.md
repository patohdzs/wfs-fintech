## House Hunters: Predicting Real Estate Prices Using Machine Learning in Python
Are you interested in machine learning and data science applications in finance? Warwick Finance Societies and Warwick Analytics Society are glad to bring to you 'House Hunters: Predicting Real Estate Prices Using Machine Learning in Python'.
In this workshop we will take you through the ins and outs of what is required to build an elementary machine learning model with real-life applications in finance. The workshop will cover:
- Overview of the modelling process
- Theory and practice behind two different ML models for regression-type problems
- Small interactive coding exercises
- (Optional) Guidance in submitting to a Kaggle competition

We will ensure to talk you through both the theoretical and practical side of proceedings, and by the end of the session you should have your very own model that will predict property prices.
No downloads or software will be required for this session. We will take you through everything you need to know step by step and, although some experience in Python is desirable, we welcome coders of all backgrounds.
This promises to be a super interesting and insightful event, and we really look forward to seeing you there!
